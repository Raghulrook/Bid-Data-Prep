# the numerical operator that are used in python
+ for Addition
- for Subraction
* for Multiplucation
/ for Float Division
% for Modulus
 
# Bonus 
** for Power Multiplication
// for Intiger Division
 
# like in Practically 
Dick=5
Pussy=10
 
print("Addition of Dick and Pussy",Dick+Pussy) # Addition
print("Subraction of Dick and Pussy",Dick-Pussy) # Subraction
print("Multiplucation of Dick and Pussy",Dick*Pussy) # Multiplucation
print("Float Division of Dick and Pussy",Dick/Pussy) # Float Division
print("Modulus of Dick and Pussy",Dick%Pussy) # Modulus 

# Bonus 
print("Power Multiplication of Dick and Pussy",Dick**Pussy) # Power Multiplication 
print("Intiger Division of Dick and Pussy",Dick//Pussy) # Intiger Division

# Arithimatic operators for words like in Practically 
Dick="RO"
Pussy="OK"

print("Addition of Dick and Pussy using words",Dick+Pussy) # Addition

Rather Addtion other operators are not working 
#print("Subraction of Dick and Pussy",Dick-Pussy) # Subraction
#print("Multiplucation of Dick and Pussy",Dick*Pussy) # Multiplucation
#print("Float Division of Dick and Pussy",Dick/Pussy) # Float Division
#print("Modulus of Dick and Pussy",Dick%Pussy) # Modulus 
# Bonus 
#print("Power Multiplication of Dick and Pussy",Dick**Pussy) # Power Multiplication 
#print("Intiger Division of Dick and Pussy",Dick//Pussy) # Intiger Division

# Combination of Numaric and Variable like in Practically 
Dick="ROOK"
Pussy=10
 
print("Multiplying the Combination of Numaric and Variable-Dick and Pussy",Dick*Pussy) # Multiplucation

Rather Multiplucation other operators are not working 
#print("Addition of Dick and Pussy",Dick+Pussy) # Addition
#print("Subraction of Dick and Pussy",Dick-Pussy) # Subraction
#print("Float Division of Dick and Pussy",Dick/Pussy) # Float Division
#print("Modulus of Dick and Pussy",Dick%Pussy) # Modulus 

# the Assignment operators that are used in python like they are assinging the value using some shortcuts
=  , x = 5
+= , x += 5 -> x = x + 5
-= , x -= 5 -> x = x - 5
*= , x *= 5 -> x = x * 5
/= , x /= 5 -> x = x / 5
//= , x //= 5 -> x = x // 5
%= , x %= 5 -> x = x % 5

# Comparison Operators ( we compare two operand values)
== , Equals to condition , x == y
!= , Not Equals to condition , x != y
> , Greater than condition , x > y
< , Less than condition , x < y
>= , Greater than and Equals to condition , x >= y
<= , Less than and Equals to condition , x <= y
