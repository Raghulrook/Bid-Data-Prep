# Bid-Data-Prep
# From Scratch To The Professional

# now we see about the numerical operator that are used in python
+ for Addition
- for Subraction
* for Multiplucation
/ for Float Division
% for Modulus
 
# Bonus 
** for Power Multiplication
// for Intiger Division
 
# like in Practically 
Dick=5
Pussy=10
 
print("Addition of Dick and Pussy",Dick+Pussy) # Addition
print("Subraction of Dick and Pussy",Dick-Pussy) # Subraction
print("Multiplucation of Dick and Pussy",Dick*Pussy) # Multiplucation
print("Float Division of Dick and Pussy",Dick/Pussy) # Float Division
print("Modulus of Dick and Pussy",Dick%Pussy) # Modulus 

# Bonus 
print("Power Multiplication of Dick and Pussy",Dick**Pussy) # Power Multiplication 
print("Intiger Division of Dick and Pussy",Dick//Pussy) # Intiger Division
