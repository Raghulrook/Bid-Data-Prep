# See how tuple works 
#Immutable object
#empty tuple
t1 = ()
#by adding () itself it known as tuple and can't add or remove from the element in the index 
#failed assignment and append
#t1.append(5)
#t1[0] = 3

t2 = (20,30,40,50)
print(len(t2))

# indexing also works for tuple
# access 3rd element from tuple

print(t2[2])

# Indexing works
# Slicing works
# Iteration also works
