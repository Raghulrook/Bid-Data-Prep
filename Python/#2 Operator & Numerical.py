+ for Addition

# Arithimatic operators for words like in Practically

print("Addition of Table and Mug using words",Table+Mug) # Addition

Rather Addtion other operators are not working 
#print("Subraction of Table and Mug",Table-Mug) # Subraction
#print("Multiplucation of Table and Mug",Table*Mug) # Multiplucation
#print("Float Division of Table and Mug",Table/Mug) # Float Division

# Combination of Numaric and Variable like in Practically 
Table="ROOK"

print("Multiplying the Combination of Numaric and Variable-Table and Mug",Table*Mug) # Multiplucation

Rather Multiplucation other operators are not working 
#print("Addition of Table and Mug",Table+Mug) # Addition
#print("Subraction of Table and Mug",Table-Mug) # Subraction
#print("Float Division of Table and Mug",Table/Mug) # Float Division

# the Assignment operators that are used in python like they are assinging the value using some shortcuts
=  , x = 5
+= , x += 5 -> x = x + 5
-= , x -= 5 -> x = x - 5
*= , x *= 5 -> x = x * 5
**= , x *= 5 -> x = x ** 5
/= , x /= 5 -> x = x / 5
//= , x //= 5 -> x = x // 5
%= , x %= 5 -> x = x % 5

# Assignment operators Usage in Practically 
A=2
B=2
C=2
D=2
E=2
F=2
G=2
A += 5 
B -= 5 
C *= 5 
D /= 5 
E **= 5 
F //= 5 
G %= 5 
print("A = ",A)
print("B = ",B)
print("C = ",C)
print("D = ",D)
print("E = ",E)
print("F = ",F)
print("G = ",G)

# Comparison Operators ( we compare two operand values) it appears like in boolean fnction neither True or False
== , Equals to condition , x == y
!= , Not Equals to condition , x != y
> , Greater than condition , x > y
< , Less than condition , x < y
>= , Greater than and Equals to condition , x >= y
<= , Less than and Equals to condition , x <= y

# Comparison operators Usage in Practically 
a = 10
b = 5
print("Result of a == b,",a == b)
print("Result of a != b,", a != b)
print("Result of a > b,", a > b)
print("Result of a < b,", a < b)
print("Result of a >= b,", a >= b)
print("Result of a <= b,", a <= b)

# logical operators in Python ( Logical check will happen for expression result)
and -> Returns true if both statements are true 
or -> Returns true if one of statements are true
not -> Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true

# logical operators Usage in Practically 
m = 10
n = 8
o = 9
print("m = 10, n = 8, o = 9")
print("m>o And n<o Result " , m>o and n<o) # False and True -> False
print("m>o Or n<o Result " , m>o or n<o) # False or True -> 
print("Not (m>20 And n<10) Result " , not(m>o and n<o)) # not(False and True) -> not(False) -> True
print("Not (m>o Or n<o) Result " , not(m>o or n<o)) # not(False or True) -> not(True) -> Flase

# logical operators Usage in Practically by user input
M=int(input("Enter the input for M",))
O=int(input("Enter the input for O",))
N=int(input("Enter the input for N",))

print("M>O And N<O Result " , M>O and N<O) # False and True -> False
print("M>O Or N<O Result " , M>O or N<O) # False or True -> True
print("Not (M>O And N<O) Result " , not(M>O and N<O)) # not(False and True) -> not(False) -> True
print("Not (M>O Or N<O) Result " , not(M>O or N<O)) # not(False or True) -> not(True) -> False
