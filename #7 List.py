#List is sequensial data type which holds Many data types in it like Int, String, Float i.e-
Be = [1,'Witch',3.45]
print("",type(Be))

#Rather like array it is differ from it like array holds only Homogenous data type where as list is a Heterogeneous
#Syntax of list in python
A = [ ] #knows as empty list
print("",type(A))#by this u can know the data type of A

#See how to concade a values in the empty list
A = [ ]
A.append('String') #we can add a number using append comand but in the parenthesis we can't give camma or other variable but we acan give dat a type as it shown
A.append(4.65)
A.append(143)
print("",A)
print("",type(A))

#add 1-100 in a empty list
A = [ ]
for spare in range(1,11):
 A.append(spare)
print("The Element In The List\n",A) #taking the print out of the loop make more difference like when it is out of the loop the loop get over and the last value get print the output rather more line and time comsuming 
print("Here It is\n",type(A))

#see how to get the length of the list
A = [ ]
