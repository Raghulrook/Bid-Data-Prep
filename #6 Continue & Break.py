# How to use break statement
int_list = [1,5,7,8,19,13,17,3]

# Find the even value in the given list
for num in int_list:
    print("Current element of the list = ",num)
    if num%2 == 0:
        print("Even number in the list = ",num)
        break

# What is break is removed?
for num in int_list:
    print("Current element of the list = ",num)
    if num%2 == 0:
        print("Even number in the list = ",num)

# How to use continue keyword?
# Print the numbers from for loop and start them from value 1
# but print values on terminal if number is greater than 10

for num in range(1,21): # range(1,21) -> [1,2,3,4,5,6....20]
    if num<10:
        continue
    print(num)
